## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles

Due to the inconsistency of the API, my web application does not currently fetch ingredients because I was running
into problems iterating and accessing them. As a continuation of my project, I would like to get this component onto the webpage.

Inconsistency among the API also pushed me to change my inital wireframe a bit. I built helper functions 
to handle null, undefined, or empty strings returned by the API to help me with this issue.

At times, my application may take a while to load leaving the user with uncertainty as to whether their data will be returned or
if the webpage "bugged out". As a continuation, I would like to build a progress ring or animation for that loading time.
