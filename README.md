## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles

Inconsistency among the API, pushed me to change my inital wireframe a bit. 
I also had to build several helper functions to handle null, undefined, or empty strings returned by the API.

Due to the inconsistency of the API, my web application does not currently fetch ingredients because I was running
into problems accessing them in the fetch.
