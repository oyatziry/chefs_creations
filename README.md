# Chefs Creations

Chefâ€™s Creations is a website users can go to for recipe inspiration given the current pantry items they have available. Users will be able to add their food items in a form section and the algorithm would return a list of recipe ideas they could make given the inputted food items.

## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles

Due to the inconsistency of the API, my web application does not currently fetch ingredients because I was running
into problems iterating and accessing them. As a continuation of my project, I would like to get this component onto the webpage.

Inconsistency among the API also pushed me to change my inital wireframe a bit. I built helper functions 
to handle null, undefined, or empty strings returned by the API to help me with this issue.

At times, my application may take a while to load leaving the user with uncertainty as to whether their data will be returned or
if the webpage "bugged out". As a continuation, I would like to build a progress ring or animation for that loading time.
